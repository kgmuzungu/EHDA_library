The operational window of this mode regarding the electric potential and liquid flow rate is presented. From the data it could be concluded that this mode can be divided by the characteristics of its breakup mechanism and that these characteristics are a function of the liquid Weber number and the electric Bond number for a given setup. Additionally we were also able to calculate the average charge per droplet and define the average size of primary and satellite droplets. The dispersion of the spray was also studied regarding its relation to the liquid Weber number and to the electric Bond number. We conclude that simple-jet mode electrosprays are a good option for applications which require monodisperse micrometer droplets with high throughput. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

  abstractnote = {Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of liquid dielectric constant on existing scaling laws for the electrospraying process. The variations of the droplet size and the emitted current were measured as a function of the dielectric constant for the electrospray operating in the cone-jet mode. Eight different solvents with dielectric constants, κ, ranging from 12.5 to 182 were tested. The residue particle size distributions were measured using a TSI scanning mobility particle sizer, (SMPS). The produced liquid droplet sizes were then calculated from the known solution concentrations. The results show that: (1) For the produced droplet size, Dd, experimental data are in agreement with the scaling law (G(κ) = 1.66κ −1/6) proposed by Gañán-Calvo et al. (1994) for solvents with high dielectric constants. The derivation in low dielectric constant cases may be that the assumption of Gañán-Calvo (1994) on the characteristic length may not hold for the present system; (2) for the emitted current, I, experimental data deviate from those given by Fernández de la Mora and Loscertales (1994) except for the case of benzyl alcohol. The difference may be partially explained by the use of different electrolytes. A larger deviation is found in comparing with the equation, f(κ) = 6.46κ1/4, provided by Gañán-Calvo et al. (1994). The reasons may be due to the inapplicable characteristic length assumption and the role of ion drifting current in the total emitted current. Based on the experimental data collected, some problems are pointed out regarding the criteria proposed in the previous studies for predicting the minimum liquid feed rate. A formula is given based on these data to estimate the maximum feed rate and to explain the observations reported in Chen et al. (1995). © 1997 American Association for Aerosol Research.},

  abstractnote = {One of the major unknown factors when working with electrosprays is the precise spraying mode that is obtained when operating an electrospray. However, as the spraying mode determines to a significant extent the properties of the obtained particles, knowing the spraying mode is crucial for many applications. Currently the spraying modes presented in the literature are defined based on optical observations of the liquid meniscus. In a laboratory set-up this approach works fine but in many other situations such an approach is not feasible. For this reason a different approach is developed which uses measurements of the current through an electrospray system to determine the spraying mode of the system. These measurements are relatively simple and can be implemented cost effectively. Although not all spraying modes can be distinguished using this approach, the spraying modes used in most applications can be identified.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
