  abstractnote = {Experiments were conducted in order to study and characterize electrohydrodynamic atomization in the simple-jet mode for inviscid liquids. The operational window of this mode regarding the electric potential and liquid flow rate is presented. From the data it could be concluded that this mode can be divided by the characteristics of its breakup mechanism and that these characteristics are a function of the liquid Weber number and the electric Bond number for a given setup. Additionally we were also able to calculate the average charge per droplet and define the average size of primary and satellite droplets. The dispersion of the spray was also studied regarding its relation to the liquid Weber number and to the electric Bond number. We conclude that simple-jet mode electrosprays are a good option for applications which require monodisperse micrometer droplets with high throughput. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

  abstractnote = {Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of liquid dielectric constant on existing scaling laws for the electrospraying process. The variations of the droplet size and the emitted current were measured as a function of the dielectric constant for the electrospray operating in the cone-jet mode. Eight different solvents with dielectric constants, κ, ranging from 12.5 to 182 were tested. The residue particle size distributions were measured using a TSI scanning mobility particle sizer, (SMPS). The produced liquid droplet sizes were then calculated from the known solution concentrations. The results show that: (1) For the produced droplet size, Dd, experimental data are in agreement with the scaling law (G(κ) = 1.66κ −1/6) proposed by Gañán-Calvo et al. (1994) for solvents with high dielectric constants. The derivation in low dielectric constant cases may be that the assumption of Gañán-Calvo (1994) on the characteristic length may not hold for the present system; (2) for the emitted current, I, experimental data deviate from those given by Fernández de la Mora and Loscertales (1994) except for the case of benzyl alcohol. The difference may be partially explained by the use of different electrolytes. A larger deviation is found in comparing with the equation, f(κ) = 6.46κ1/4, provided by Gañán-Calvo et al. (1994). The reasons may be due to the inapplicable characteristic length assumption and the role of ion drifting current in the total emitted current. Based on the experimental data collected, some problems are pointed out regarding the criteria proposed in the previous studies for predicting the minimum liquid feed rate. A formula is given based on these data to estimate the maximum feed rate and to explain the observations reported in Chen et al. (1995). © 1997 American Association for Aerosol Research.},

  abstractnote = {One of the major unknown factors when working with electrosprays is the precise spraying mode that is obtained when operating an electrospray. However, as the spraying mode determines to a significant extent the properties of the obtained particles, knowing the spraying mode is crucial for many applications. Currently the spraying modes presented in the literature are defined based on optical observations of the liquid meniscus. In a laboratory set-up this approach works fine but in many other situations such an approach is not feasible. For this reason a different approach is developed which uses measurements of the current through an electrospray system to determine the spraying mode of the system. These measurements are relatively simple and can be implemented cost effectively. Although not all spraying modes can be distinguished using this approach, the spraying modes used in most applications can be identified.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The paper was motivated by the following observation: φ(x+y)φ(x−y) is a positive definite function of two variables x,y. We say that a positive definite function φ on an Abelian group G is cross positive definite (c.p.d.) if, for each z∈G, the function φ(x+y+z)φ(x−y) of two variables x,y is positive definite. We say that a finite Radon measure on a locally compact Abelian group is c.p.d. if its Fourier transform is a c.p.d. function on the dual group. We investigate properties of c.p.d. functions and measures and give some integral characterizations. It is proved that the classes of c.p.d. functions and measures are closed with respect to certain natural operations. In particular, products, convolutions and Fourier transforms of c.p.d. functions and measures are c.p.d., whenever defined.}

We assume that these variables have a common unknown scale parameter and that the mean of the normal variable is also unknown. We compare the risk functions of two Bayesian predictive densities: one with respect to a hierarchical shrinkage prior and the other based on a noninformative prior. The hierarchical Bayesian predictive density depends on the normal variable while the Bayesian predictive density based on the noninformative prior does not. Sufficient conditions for the former to dominate the latter are obtained. These predictive densities are compared by simulation.}

	abstract = {Classification is one of the important tasks in data mining and machine learning. Classification performance depends on many factors as well as data characteristics. Some algorithms are known to work better with discrete data. In contrast, most real-world data contain continuous variables. For algorithms working with discrete data, these continuous variables must be converted to discrete ones. In this process called discretization, continuous variables are converted to their corresponding discrete variables. In this paper, four Chi-square based supervised discretization algorithms ChiMerge(ChiM), Chi2, Extended Chi2(ExtChi2) and Modified Chi2(ModChi2) were used. In the literature, the performance of these algorithms is often tested with decision trees and Naïve Bayes classifiers. In this study, differently, four sets of data discretized by these algorithms were classified with ensemble methods. Classification accuracies for these data sets were obtained through using a stratified 10-fold cross-validation method. The classification performance of the original and discrete data sets of the methods is presented comparatively. According to the results, the performance of the discrete data is more successful than the original data.}

	abstract = {Free-Comment (FC) and Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) provide a contingency table containing citation counts of descriptors by products. The analyses performed on this table are most often related to the chi-square statistic. However, such practices are not well suited because they consider experimental units as being the citations (one descriptor for one product by one subject) while the evaluations (vector of citations for one product by one subject) should be considered instead. This results in incorrect expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of independence between products and descriptors and thus in an incorrect chi-square statistic. Thus, analyses related to this incorrect chi-square statistic, which include Correspondence Analysis, can lead to wrong interpretations. This paper presents a modified chi-square square framework dedicated to the analysis of multiple-response data in which experimental units are the evaluations and which is, therefore, better suited to FC and CATA data. This new framework includes a multiple-response dimensionality test of dependence, a multiple-response Correspondence Analysis, and a multiple-response hypergeometric test to investigate which descriptors are significantly associated with which product. The benefits of the multiple-response chi-square framework over the usual chi-square framework are exhibited on real CATA data. An R package called “MultiResponseR” is available upon request to the authors and on GitHub to perform the multiple-response chi-square analyses.}
